This hand gesture recognition project leverages computer vision techniques to detect and classify gestures captured by a camera. Using image segmentation, contour detection, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system can recognize gestures in real-time. The project is aimed at enabling touch-free interaction for smart devices and other applications, with flexibility to expand the gesture library. OpenCV and deep learning models work together to provide an accurate and responsive gesture recognition experience.
